### Demo:
To sure the capabilities of Komiser, Komiser was installed on an EC2 instance running on AWS. The installation process was a straight and an easy one. For the Demo, the EC2 instance is running on a Linux operating system. To install run this commands;

```
wget https://cli.komiser.io/latest/komiser_Linux_x86_64 -O komiser
chmod +x komiser
sudo mv komiser /usr/bin
```

The above commands install komiser as well as make it executable. The komiser command requires a passed whenever you want to start the komiser server.

This configuration file contains information needed to run the komiser server. Information such as credentials of the cloud platform needed to authenticate komiser to its cloud resources, database needed to persist data collected by the server to increase speed of subsequent data collection, Kubernetes configuration file to sync with any Kubernetes cluster etc.

This is the sample configuration used for this demo;
```
[[aws]]
name="Admin-account"
source="CREDENTIALS_FILE"
path=".aws/credentials"
profile="default"
komiser start --config config.toml 
[[k8s]]
name="demo-account"
path="/home/ubuntu/.kube/config"

[sqlite]
file="komiser.db"
```

To allow komiser access to the AWS account, an access key ID and access secret key has to be generated and stored in a file in the system. The path of this file is passed to `path` of the `[[aws]]` block while the block name of the credentials is passed to `profile`.

This is a sample file containing the AWS credentials;

```
[default] # block name
region=us-east-1
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

To start the komiser server run this command;

```
komiser start --config config.toml
```

In this demo, the created config.toml is located in the root directory. To access the komiser server go to publicip:3000. The instance should have a public IP which is used to access the komiser server on port 3000.
